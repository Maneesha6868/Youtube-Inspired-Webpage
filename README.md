# Youtube-Inspired-Webpage
Following my 12th-grade exams, I explored web development by designing a YouTube-style webpage using only HTML and CSS. This project was a hands-on learning experience that allowed me to recreate the layout and feel of a familiar platform purely through structural and visual design techniques.

Objectives:
- Understand the foundational structure of a web page using HTML
- Replicate a recognizable layout (similar to YouTube) with CSS styling
  
Key Features:
- A clean header with a logo, search bar (static), and profile ico
- Grid layout of video thumbnails, titles, and channel names
- Use of Flexbox/Grid for organizing elements
- Responsive design basics for desktop and tablet views
  
Skills Learned & Applied:
- HTML5 elements for semantic layout and accessibility
- CSS styling including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout techniques
- Flexbox and Grid to create structured and visually appealing content
- Attention to visual hierarchy and design consistency
  
Reflection:
This was my first solo design project, and working only with HTML and CSS showed me how much can be achieved with the basics. It was exciting to see a simple idea take shape with code, and it sparked my interest in learning more about web development.
